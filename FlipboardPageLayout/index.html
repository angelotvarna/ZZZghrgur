						<h3>COSMIC EVOLUTION<span>Published April 13, 2014</span></h3>
	    
		
	      
	   
	 
	<p>
	    The opposite of creation is pantheism (Evolution, Naturalism, Materialism, Determinism, Existentialism, Hinduism, Monism, Wicca and so on). All these
	    ascribe the creative powers of God to Nature. That God is one consciousness that is in with everything including you because you are also god. That God is
	    Nature and does not exist outside this reality. Thereby prescribing an eternal age of the Universe (or cyclically regenerative) with power to create life
	    all by itself.
	</p>
	 
 
	<p class="clr">
	<ol class="list">The ancient Hindu Brahmans believed that:
	</p>
	 
		<li>The Universe is cyclical</li>
		<li>The particle/egg expands and explodes forming the Universe</li>
		<li>Out of this there is an evolutionary progression from particles to life</li>    
		<li>This process takes billions of years</li>    
		 <br>
			Sound familiar?
			 
			</ol>
	 
	<p>Paganism can be best described as a concept of "god" which is rooted (if you'll pardon the expression) in nature itself which receives the reverence due to
	    God. It is the belief that nature itself, is in some way, a god, or a pantheon of gods and it/they are worthy of worship and adoration. In this schema such
	    things as 'tree gods' and 'mountain gods' can be placated by certain 'sacrifices.' The related Pantheism is the belief that all of nature is part of god,
	    or indeed, the total of god. It is a very old belief system but the reverence and worship of nature is always involved somewhere. In our day, the pervasive
	    influence of New Ageism has quite blatantly re-introduced many pagan sensibilities.
	</p>
	<p>
	   <img class="fl" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TYuSyncsb9o/UQxPPC8g8uI/AAAAAAAAAr0/SolIEvmaapg/s320/WEB_Still_Galaxy_02.jpg"> 
	    Evolutionary doctrines thrive within paganism. A sort of cosmic evolution can also be found in the Hundi philosophy:
	</p>
	     <blockquote><p>
		Indeed, Hindus were Spinozists 2000 years before the birth of Spinoza, Darwinians many centuries before the birth of Darwin, and evolutionists,
		centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been accepted by Aldus Huxleys of our times, and before any word like evolution existed in any language
		in this world. Sir M. Monier-Williams, Professor of Sanskrit, University of Oxford
	    </p></blockquote>
	    
	    <blockquote> <p>
		These (creative processes) in succession acquire the attributes of the immediately preceding ones from which they have originated. Each has not only its
		own special attribute but each succeeding one has the attributes of all the previous ones. (As earlier source: 8:239:179)
	    </p></blockquote>
	
	<p>
	    So we see here the principle of things being gradually built up from the very simple over long periods of time - evolution in all but name!

						<h3>EVOLUTION OF VISHNU<span>Published April 14, 2014</span></h3>
						   
						  
						   
						     <p>
						       "The incarnations of Vishnu (Dashavatara) is almost identical to the scientific explanation of the sequence of biological evolution of man and animals. The
						       sequence of avatars starts from an aquatic organism (Matsya), to an amphibian (Kurma), to a land-animal (Varaha), to a humanoid (Narasimha), to a dwarf
						       human (Vamana), to 5 forms of well developed human beings (Parashurama, Rama, Balarama/Buddha, Krishna, Kalki) who showcase an increasing form of
						       complexity (Axe-man, King, Plougher/Sage, wise Statesman, mighty Warrior). In India, the home country of Hindus; educated Hindus widely accept the theory
						       of biological evolution. In a survey, 77% of respondents in India agreed that enough scientific evidence exists to support the Darwinian Theory of
						       Evolution, and 85 per cent of God-believing people said they believe in evolution as well." (Wikipedia)
						   </p>
						     <p>

						   <p><h3><strong>ANCIENT ROOTS OF RACISM</strong>
						    </h3>
						     <p>
						       Darwin himself had noted that 'natural selection' was more or less already represented in Aristotle (Aristotle, Physics, 2:8:2), but the really interesting
						       thing is its appearance in Hindu thinking. The 'big bang' too seems to make an appearance!
						   </p>
						   <p>
						       In the preface to the Third Edition of The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin a devout racist wrote:
						       <br/>
						       <blockquote>"Until recently the great majority of naturalists believed that species were immutable productions, and had been separately created. This view has been
						       ably maintained by many authors. Some few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of
						       life are the descendants by true generation of pre-existing forms. Passing over allusions to the subject in the classical writers. We see here the
						       principle of Natural Selection shadowed forth- Aristotle, in his 'Physicae Auscultationes' (lib. 2, cap. 8, s. 2)"</blockquote>
						   </p>
						   
						   
						   
						    <p><strong>BRAHMIN RASIST PHILOSOPHY</strong>
						       The tendency in human nature to discriminate against people because of their skin colour, social standing, or birth, and to consider one racial group to be
						       more pure than another, is probably as old as mankind itself. Racism was alive and well in ancient India, where pale-skinned Indo-European brahmins placed
						       themselves at the pinnacle of a caste system that included nobles, merchants, workers and the universally denigrated outcasts.
						   </p>
						   <p>
						       Notice when it came to man you have a caste system of 5 races which starts from dark skinned people to the highest caste who are the Brahmin
						   </p>  
						   <p> <img class="fl" src="file:images/pyramid.png">
						     Brahmin Master Gotama, says the following regarding anicent Hindu Brahman Race Philosophy: <blockquote>"Brahmins are the highest caste, those of any other caste are inferior; brahmins are the fairest caste, those of any
						   other caste are dark; only brahmins are purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins alone are the.... offspring of Brahma....."  </blockquote><a href="http://www.lakehouse.lk/mihintalava/prac07.htm">http://www.lakehouse.lk/mihintalava/prac07.htm</a>

						       <img class="fl" width="350" src="file:images/ari.png">
						       
						    <strong>Brahmin Aryans were white skinned philosopher kings</strong> (The dream nation of Hitler)<br> <strong>Aryan</strong> 
						    
						       White skinned statesmen and high priests
						   </p>
						   <p>
						       There are also signs of evolutionary concepts in the Indian caste system. In this caste system, favored ones might rise through the castes, eventually
						       becoming 'god' (or, that was seen as the goal) but there is no doubt that some Hindu writers saw this in a biological evolutionary sense.
						   </p>
						   <p>
						       "Whatever creature is born is resolved once more...and is moved again by the merits and demerits acquired in that life (and) enters into another body
						       resulting from its deeds." (Mahabharata Mokshadharma Parva 275: 298-299).

						       Kshatriya RajputThe Kshatriyas are a large group of Hindu castes, located mainly in the northern half of India. The Sanskrit term <em>kshatra </em>means
						       'warrior, ruler' and identifies the second raking varna, below Brahmins. Kshatriya have traditionally been expected to maintain law and order and protect
						       the land from attackers from the outside.

						   <p>
						       The Vaisya are the third highest of the four varnas. They are ranked below the Brahmins and Kshatriyas but are higher than Sudras and Untouchables. They
						       have traditionally been traders, moneylenders, farmers and peasants, and now work in a large number of castes with similar ranking.

						   </p>
						   <p>
						       The Sudras are the lowest of the four varnas but are higher than Untouchables. They are generally rural laborers. The classical 2nd century lawgiver Manu
						       defined their roles as those serving the three higher ranking varnas above them.

						       <strong>Untouchables (oh dear)</strong>
						       <strong></strong>
						   </p>
						   <p>
						       "Untouchables" are generally defined as people belonging to castes that rank below the Sudra varna. They have traditionally been regarded as having such
						       low status they don't even register on the caste system. There are an estimated 170 to 240 million of them, depending how different castes are counted, and
						       they make up one sixth to one forth of India's population. The term 'Untouchable' was first used in 1909 in a lecture by the Maharaja Sayaji Rao III of
						       Baroda to describe the primary features of the group relationship with other castes. [Source: Tom ONeill, National Geographic, June 2003]
						   </p>
						  
						   <p>
						       Untouchables have traditionally been forbidden from entering Hindu temples and schools, or touching members of other castes (hence their name).

						<h3>SIMPLE TO COMPLEX <span>Published April 10, 2014</span></h3>
												    
							<p>
							    Ancient Hindus believed that Life evolves only from pre-existing Life. Transmigration of Soul through different Species as discussed in the 3rd post (Creation by Brahma), Hindu Creation closely follows
							    actual appearance of elements in our Universe:
							</p>
							
							<blockquote><p>
							    First appear the intangible substances followed by the tangible matter; followed by the immovable planets and landmasses; then the vegetation; birds,
							    aquatics and animals; and finally the Higher species.
							</p></blockquote>
							<p>
							    Taking an example from Hindu Philosophy, one of the most important concepts in Hinduism is of Sansaar/Samsara. All religions of Indian origin viz. Jainism,
							    Budhism, Sikhism and the numerous other sects, believe in this concept and I'm sure most of you are aware of it as well. The concept is also known as the
							    Transmigration of Soul, and refers to an endless cycle of re-incarnation that a soul must undergo in order to fulfill its Karma.
							</p>
							  <img class="fl" border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Reincarnation_AS.jpg/330px-Reincarnation_AS.jpg" alt="reincarnation-right"/>
							    
							 
							<p>
							    A soul takes birth in different species of life until it attains the form of a Human-being that enables it to strive for Nirvana. Compare this concept with
							    the diagram above and you will immediately observe the similarity with Evolution!

							<blockquote><p>"By Tapas (heat) the power of meditation Brahman (the Universe) attains expansion and then comes primeval matter, and from this comes life." (Mundaka Upanishad 1:1)</p></blockquote>

								<p>
								    It is interesting that most branches of modern Hinduism are sympathetic to the teaching of evolution. This should not be so surprising because several
								    ancient sanskrit scripts do appear to speak of evolution, of a fashion. Hinduism also always teaches that the world is many millions of years old - in
								    complete contrast to the biblical testimony.

						    <h3>ETERNITY OF THE SOUL<span>Published May 3, 2012</span></h3>
						
							<p>
							    
							    Enlightenment is actually coming to the knowledge and understanding that you are God. Because if nature really has the capability to produce the universe and the order in it, then it would be logical that there is no transcendent cause or God necessary and our universe really is eternal or cyclical. Nature has therefore 'divine' capacity; if there is a God then he is in nature and thus in ourselves. We can come to the realization to the eternity of our spirit and divinity through this enlightening knowledge.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <img class="fl" width="350" src="https://www.soulstorage.org/data/images/fooldal_cikkek_kepei/reincarnation_10.jpg">
							    In Hindu philosophy, we may recall, the state of 'enlightenment' is a state in which one finally comes to be 'at one' with god, or to realize that one is
							    god; a 'oneness' with nature is part of that experience. Such 'enlightenment' is, of course, nothing short of the deification of man. Of course, the West
							    also had an 18th century 'enlightenment' of an intellectual sort in which, it is said, modern man 'came of age.' From that point too, European men and
							    women were told that they no longer needed any transcendent God for they themselves were now as 'intellectual gods' fully capable of advancing themselves
							    by their own work and learning.
							</p>
							<p class="clr">
							    <p>
							    <strong>Monism</strong>- the belief that reality is one pure consciousness, there is no differentiation between good and evil, and that your soul is god.
							    </p>
							
							    
							    <blockquote>Arthur Kesler,Hungarian-British author and journalist: <p>What are your thoughts about Hitler's atrocities?</p> 
							 
							   Zen Buddhist scholar:<p>That was very silly of him.</p> 
							 
							   Arthur Kesler:<p>Just silly? Not evil?</p>
							 
							  Zen Buddhist: <p>Evil is a Christian invention.</p></blockquote>

						<h3>PYTHAGORAS ~500BC<span>Published May 3, 2012</span></h3>
								  
							        
							       <p>
								   "Pythagoras travelled widely, studying esoteric teachings of the <strong>Egyptians, Assyrians, and even the Brahmins (Hindus).</strong>" (Lamblichus,
								   Biography of Pythagoras).
							       </p>
							      
							      
							     
								  <blockquote>"It is more likely that Pythagoras was influenced by India than by Egypt. Almost all the theories, religious, philosophical and mathematical
								   teachings of the Pythagoreans were known in India in the sixth century BC." <p>Professor H.G. Rawlinson</p></blockquote> 
							  
							        <p>
								   Hindu influences on Pythagoras =>Pantheism, Reincarnation, asceticism, Vegetarianism, not cutting nails, beards and hair.<br>
							        
							       </p>
							       
							     <p>
								   'Natural Selection' has been detected in Pythagoras and, as is well known, Plato built upon Pythagoras:
							      This is Brahmin evolutionary thought - now occurring among the Greeks, and many hundreds of years before Darwin!
							     
							     
							      <blockquote> 
								   "These are the principles on which living creatures change and have changed into one another, the transformation depending on the loss or gain of
								   understanding or folly."<p> (Plato, Timaeus 49: 80-108)</p></blockquote>

						<h3>PLATO AND ARISTOTEL ~350BC<span>Published May 3, 2012</span></h3>
					
								 
								 
							       
							       
							       <p>
								   Although Plato saw transcendence in the Universe but he was taught by Socrates who believed in reincarnation:
							       </p>
							      
								         <blockquote>"If all things which partook of life were to die, and after they were dead remained in the form of death, and did not come to life again, all
								       would at last die, and nothing be alive---what other result could there be? ... Must not all things at last be swallowed up in death? ... But I am
								       confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead, and that the souls of the dead are in existence,
								       and that good souls have a better portion than the evil."<p>  Socrates, who was a Reincarnationist as well as a philosopher</p></blockquote>
								   </em>
							       <p> 
								   Plato had influence from Socrates and the Pythagoreans (everything came from fire). Plato is an incredibly controversial figure because he believed that
								   God created the Universe but also believed that the Universe is eternal. Two very hard concepts to juggle as he believed in creation as much as evolution:
							       
							       <blockquote>"These are the principles on which living creatures change and have changed into one another, the transformation depending on the loss or gain of
								   understanding or folly."<p> (Plato, Timaeus<em>Reincarnation and transformations</em> 49:90-108)</p></blockquote>
							        
							      
							      <p>Taught by Plato and the Pythagoreans, Aristotle also held a form of evolutionary theory as influenced his.
							       </p>
							       
								<blockquote>"Naturally, gradually, step by step, developed from inanimate substances to living creatures...other bloodless animals generate indeed...but from decaying
								   earth and excrements."<p>(Aristotle- <em>Generation of Animals</em> 1:1:20-25)</p></blockquote>

						   <p>Although theistic, this philosophy holds that universe is a closed system and that the natural world contains divinity within and therefore exhausts all explanations of reality.

						    <blockquote>
							"Animals come into being from moisture evaporated by the sun. Humans originally resembled another type of animal, namely fish."<p>(Hippolytus, Refutation of
							all Heresies, 1:6; 1-7)</p></blockquote>
						    </p>
						    <blockquote>
							"The first animals were a kind of fish, with a thorny skin (the Greek word is the same that was used for the metaphor "the bark of a tree" in Anaximander's
							cosmology). Originally, men were generated from fishes and were fed in the manner of a viviparous shark. The reason for this is said to be that the human
							child needs long protection in order to survive"<p>- http://www.iep.utm.edu/anaximan/</p></blockquote>
						    </p>
						    <p>
							=&gt;Some authors have, rather anachronistically, seen in these scattered statements a proto-evolutionist theory.
						    </p>
						  <blockquote>
							For Anaximander: "a germ, pregnant with hot and cold, was separated [or: separated itself] off from the eternal, whereupon out of this germ a sphere of
							fire grew around the vapor that surrounds the earth, like a bark round a tree." <p>(DK 12A10)</p></blockquote>
							<p>Subsequently, the sphere of fire is said to have fallen apart
							into several rings, and this event was the origin of sun, moon, and stars. There are authors who have, quite anachronistically, seen here a kind of

							<blockquote>
							    Empedocles says that the greater part of the members of animals were generated by chance... Why then should it not be the same with the parts in
							    nature, e.g. that our teeth should come up of necessity-the front teeth sharp, fitted for tearing, the molars broad and useful for grinding down the
							    food-since they did not arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with all other parts in which we suppose that there is
							    purpose? Wherever then all the parts came about just what they would have been if they had come be for an end, such things survived, being organized
							    spontaneously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish, as Empedocles says his 'man-faced ox-progeny' did

						    <p>
							Empedocles also believed on life forms that previously existed on the Earth, but many races of beings: </p>

						<h3>The Arrival of the Atomists<span>Published May 3, 2012</span></h3>
						  <p>
						    
						    Fathers of Materialism, Determinism, Naturalism and Atheism are the Atomists. Perhaps the first westen minds to propose materialism and materialism.
						    It's interesting to not that it was the reality of pain in suffereing in life that led these men to their conclusions
						    that that God doesn't exist (or at least doesn't care about humans) and that therefore the universe is run entirely by mechanistic
						    natural means.
						    <hr />
						   
								    
							<h4>Democritus<span>~400BC</span></h4>
							 <img class="fl" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Democritus2.jpg/330px-Democritus2.jpg">
						    <p>  
							    Democritus was perhaps one of the first western thorough going naturalists. He had spent a considerable time of his early life travelling (Egypt to Persia), and
							    chose to follow the tradition of another less known materialist philosopher called Leucippus. Democritus specifically denied that anything could happen by
							    chance but governed by deterministic natural laws; this is the closest to our modern understanding of science than any other idea of antiquity. Unlike
							    Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, Atomists sought to explain the world without the introduction of purpose or final cause. The atomic hypothesis was a
							    reductionist philosophy in nature that held faith in natural laws.
							</p>
							<p>
							    As so with the birth of the Atomic hypothesis, the great philosophical divide was formed between the mechanistic and teleological searches for truth and
							    explanation. The battle for the minds of men rages on today and although the names have changed, the issue is the same as well as the arguments. Should we
							    solely search for reductionist materialist causes? Should exclusively ask mechanistic questions and admit solely mechanistic answers and explanations? Is
							    purpose irrelevant? Absolutely according to Democritus, for example, the soul was composed of atoms and that thought was a physical process by
							    deterministic natural laws that had no purpose. That was the day that philosophy clashed with science.
							</p>
							<p>
							    Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism" title="Atomism">atomists</a> attempted to explain the world without reasoning
							to <em>purpose</em>, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover" title="Unmoved mover">prime mover</a></em>, or    <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_cause" title="Final cause">final cause</a></em>.
							</p>

						    </p>
						     <hr />
						<div id="abs">
						    <img class="fr" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Epikur.jpg">
						    <h4>Epicurus <span>~300BC</span></h4>
						     <p>Although, Epicurus claimed to be self taught, the only different of his worldview compared to that of Democritus was determinism. Epicurus attempted
						     to reconcile free will with atheism</p>
						     
						    <ul>As a follower of Democritus he also heald to many of the same philosophical beliefs:
							<li>The universe is infinite and eternal</li>
							<li>Natural Biological and Cosmological evolution</li>
							<li>Everything was made by randomn processes</li>
							<li>Pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil</li> 
							<li>Death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared</li>
							
						    </ul>
							
							<blockquote>"Chance takes the place of God..."<p>(Pliny the Elder<span>~50AD</span>, Natural History)</p></blockquote>
						  
						    <p> After the Christian Reformation, the Pythagorean philosophies went underground because Christianity was very strong.
